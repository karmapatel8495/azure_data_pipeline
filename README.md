Our client is one of the largest public accounting, consulting, and technology firms in the U.S. with a need to process massive amounts of healthcare data. In particular, the client’s “Revenue Analytics” product gathers data from over 1000 hospitals. As their business grows, having a decentralized database brings more disparity. It creates difficulty in scaling the infrastructure, using computing effectively, and managing failures and downtime. With this project, we facilitate the commoditization of this data in the cloud using Kubernetes and Blob storage. This approach allows us to create an easily accessible, robust and centralized data and analysis platform meeting the needs of various stakeholders. Moreover, this new data architecture overcomes the challenges of the client’s current architecture in which a series of ETL transformations push data into various database locations. Previously, the client could not track the point of failures in their data pipelines. We solve this problem via Azure cloud services along with Kubernetes and Docker to design, develop and track all data pipelines. These data pipelines feed a centralized “SQL Data Hub” that drives all decision-making processes and powers enhanced BI reporting.
